A Historic Reciprocation
XMU was founded by the Malayan Chinese Mr. Tan Kah Kee in 1921. Now 93 years later, XMU has reciprocated by setting up a campus in Malaysia, where Mr. Tan Kah Kee achieved great success in his career. This is a historic reciprocation.'

- Zhu Chongshi, XMU President (2003-2017)

The Spirit Lives On
XMU founder Mr. Tan Kah Kee was considered a world-renowned educator who devoted all he had to the pursuits of education. XMU solemnly pledges to uphold Mr. Tan Kah Keeâ€™s spirit of selfless dedication to the noble causes of education in establishing XMUM. It will remain a not-for-profit institution; and not a sen will be repatriated to China. Instead any surplus funds will be channelled back into research and scholarships for students of XMUM.

Commitment to educational excellence

The establishment of XMUM sets new heights in the areas of cooperation and exchange in education between China and Malaysia. XMU is driven to build the campus into one of Malaysia's best, enriching Malaysia's tertiary education landscape to produce high-quality talents with international competitiveness.
