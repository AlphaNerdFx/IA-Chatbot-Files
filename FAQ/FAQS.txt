1. What are the initial steps for international students applying to Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM)?
To begin the application process, prospective international students must submit a completed XMUM Academic Programme application form, which can be downloaded from the university's website. Alongside the form, applicants need to provide three certified true copies of all passport pages (including blank ones), ensuring the passport has over 18 months of validity from the application submission date. Additionally, three certified true copies of academic qualifications, transcripts, or certificates in English are required. If original documents are not in English, certified translated copies must be provided, along with a certification letter from the translation company/translator. Eight passport-sized photos (3.5cm x 5.0cm) with a white background, taken within six months, and Health Examination and Medical Check-Up reports (form downloadable from XMUM website) are also mandatory. For students transferring from other Malaysian institutions, a Release Letter, Academic Transcripts/Certificates, and an Attendance Report from their previous institution are needed. Finally, details of initial fee settlement, including the Application, Registration & International Student Fees (RM 2,800) and an Accommodation Booking Fee (RM100), must be submitted. These fees can be paid via telegraphic transfer to the Public Bank Berhad account: XMU Jiageng Education Development Sdn Bhd, Account Number: 319-724-8410, with the receipt emailed to int.enquiry@xmu.edu.my.

2. What happens after an application is received and accepted by XMUM?
Upon receipt and acceptance of an applicant's submission, XMUM will issue an offer letter. This letter confirms the applicant's eligibility to enrol in an academic programme, provided the required fees have been settled. Subsequently, XMUM takes responsibility for submitting an application for a student visa/student pass to the Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS). This visa application process typically spans 6-8 weeks. Once the visa application is successful, a Visa Approval Letter (VAL) will be dispatched to the applicant's stated address after proof of advance fee payment (Telegraphic Transfer slip) is received. With the VAL, applicants are then required to apply for a single entry visa (SEV) at the Malaysian Embassy or High Commission in their home country.

3. What pre-departure checks and arrangements should international students make?
After receiving the Visa Approval Letter (VAL), international students are strongly advised to confirm with their local immigration office or the Malaysian Embassy/High Commission whether a visa is required to enter Malaysia. Once travel arrangements are confirmed, the incoming student must submit their Name, Passport Number, Traveling From, Date, Flight Number, and Arrival Time to the XMUM International Student Affairs Office one week before their departure. Copies of the flight ticket and the stamped single entry visa (SEV) must also be submitted. It is recommended to label all luggage with the student's full name and the final destination address for easy identification.

4. What essential items should international students bring with them to Malaysia?
While many everyday items are readily available for purchase in Malaysia, incoming international students are advised to bring specific essentials. These include clothes and footwear (both casual and formal), bed sheets, a cell phone, charger, and adapter plugs, and any necessary medication or prescriptions. Crucially, students must carry important documents such as their passport with at least one year of validity, their flight ticket, the XMUM Offer Letter, and the Original Visa Approval Letter (VAL), as well as their Original Academic Transcripts. It is also recommended to bring adequate money to cover living expenses for the first two months, which would include accommodation, food, travel, and books.

5. What assistance does XMUM provide upon arrival at the airport, and what are the initial accommodation rules?
Upon receiving the incoming international students' arrival details, XMUM staff will be present at the immigration checkpoint to meet them and assist with immigration clearance. Students are explicitly instructed not to arrange for friends or relatives to pick them up from the airport; any meet-up with friends or relatives is only permitted after students have checked into their on-campus hostel. After immigration, students will be transported to the hostel to complete accommodation arrangements. A mandatory requirement for all foreign students is to reside in the on-campus hostel provided by XMUM for a minimum period of one year.

6. What immediate actions are required upon arrival at XMUM regarding reporting and visa endorsement?
Upon arrival, all incoming international students are required to report to the International Student Affairs Office of XMUM within one working day. Crucially, within seven working days of arrival and after undergoing a medical check-up, students must submit their original passport, a photocopy of their passport, and their Offer Letter from XMUM to the International Student Affairs Office. These documents are vital for the endorsement of the student pass and visa by the Malaysian Immigration Department. This endorsement process typically takes approximately 3-4 weeks from the date of passport submission. Failure to comply with this procedural requirement may result in penalties for the student. It is also explicitly stated that foreigners on social, visit, dependent, or special passes are not permitted to study in Malaysia, and foreign students are forbidden from working in Malaysia during their studies.

7. What administrative and financial steps follow after visa endorsement?
After the student pass has been endorsed in the passport, the XMUM International Student Affairs Office will assist foreign students in exchanging their money into the Malaysian currency and in applying for a bank account. A bank account can only be opened once the student pass is endorsed. Upon payment of fees, foreign students will be issued a Student ID tag, which grants access to facilities within the XMUM Campus. Furthermore, tuition fees for subsequent years are to be paid on a semesterly basis before the commencement of each new semester.

8. Is there an English language requirement for international students at XMUM?
Yes, all incoming international students are required to sit for an English Placement Test, especially if they do not meet the minimum TOEFL or IELTS band scores stipulated by the university. If the results of this English Placement Test indicate a need for further language proficiency, students are then required to enrol in intensive English courses. These courses must be completed accordingly before they can officially commence their main academic programme.

9.How can students and staff submit maintenance requests at XMUM?
Students and staff at Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM) can submit maintenance requests or report defects online through a dedicated system. This system is accessible via the link: https://app.xmu.edu.my/maintenance. A step-by-step guide is available to assist users with the reporting process.
